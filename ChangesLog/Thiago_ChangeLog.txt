Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/11/03:

- Extreme Important:

	Today I had a huge problem to buil the project. The problem was at the childActor component at the MPMotionControlPawn. I still have no idea why 
	this happened. 
	Here is some tread about the topic: https://answers.unrealengine.com/questions/604285/416-updated-project-crashes-skel-linkerplaceholder.html
	I solved the problem now, but let's be careful with this component because it seems very instable. 

- For Ian: 

	Trying to debug the build I also realise that we have some materials fails. I sent you a screen shoot at slack.

- For Carlos: 

	I replied your questions at the widgets.

- WBP_MainNetworkVRMenu:

      	Modified overrided event OnClicked for QuitButton; now when vr is active, calls DestroySessionCaller. Carlos, check if this is right!! 

- WBP_CustomMenu:

	Added a quit button to leave the game. Added the same logic carlos was using to quite the game.

- BP_MP_MPMotionControllerPawnMenu:

	Remaned it to MPMotionControllerPawnMenu, just to be consistent with the rest. I was getting confuse here. :)

- BP_MotionController:

	Added tree new Events: StartAttackFeedback, UpdateAttackFeedback and ClearAttackFeedback. This call the logic Ian did for showing the player 
	how many basic attacks they still have. I created this events to be compatible with the MP implementation. Since, the feedbacks must be a 
	multicast or Run on owning RPC.

- BP_3D_HealthBar:

	Organized and compacted the new events Ian created for the attack feedback. I removed right and left events. It now gets the enumerator hand as input 
	and deals with that. This way at BP_MotionController we don't need two calls.

- BP_EarthBall:

	Added some MP logic to what Ian did. I still need to run more tests on it and make few more fixes problably. 

===========================================================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/11/02:

- General: 

	Critical merger with Carlos version and the current version. 
	Implemented almost all the widgets and change the game instance where necessary, some bugs may still happen (need to test the whole game).

- Importante for Ian:

	We add new c++ code. It can be trick sometimes for the project "see" this new implementation. You may need to compile the project using Visual Studio
	if you open your project and it don't find the new c++ classes. Since this is a game instance class you can have critical erros before the project 
	recognize it. If you have this problem give me a call. 

===========================================================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/11/01:

- Note for Ian: I have change the rotation rule on attach to relative for the basic attacks. This way the your pivot arrow at BP_EarthBall is always 
facing the hand direction. Now you just need to rotate your SMs to face it as well. I let the arrow visible for you to see it better. For the left hand 
just rotating will not make the trick since left - right hands are mirror. My suggestion here is to make a trick, instead of doing the way you did with many small pices, 
transform all this into a single SM (ue4 has a tool to do that). So the first stage u spawn the small pices toggeter in a fast way (just for visual), once this is done u replace it by the single SM (actually the SM will be there already so u can just make it invible by default then when the EFX is finish u make it visible.). I think in this way the left hand will work since the scale should be invert, if not u just need to invert the z scale from x to -x.  


- BP_MPMotionController:

	The attachment for basic attack now uses a rotation rule relative.

- BP_MotionController:
	
	The attachment for basic attack now uses a rotation rule relative.

- BP_BasicAttack:

	Trying to make lag less visible in MP.
	Added an event called ClientChangeAcceleration, this is a multicast RPC and it change the velocity locally. 
	The parameter ProjectileTarget is now replicate.
	Knowing inssue: If the lag is bigger than 200ms the client will not be able to shoot spells. This happen because the time beteween 
	shoot and recharge is 200ms, therefore, if the lag is bigger than it the spells collide. 

===========================================================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/10/30:


- General: 

	Few sound's attenuation ajustments.

- Important: At project - > settings -> rendering. I changed the anti-aliasing method from TAA to MSAA. This method is way more efficient in 
	terms of performance. Although, some of the vegetation look a bit strange. 
	For more detail check: https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Performance/ForwardRenderer/index.html 

- BP_Barrier:

	Changed the scale of SM_BackGroundHealth from 1,1,1 to 1,0.8,0.8. Solve problem with red bar being overlayer the green one when set scale.
	The event SetPercent is now a Multicast RPC and was renamed to ClientSetPercent.


- BP_EarthBarrier:

	On event Destroy first check the life of barrier if bigger than zero don't spawn the RockBarrierDM. Solve the inssue when barrier was being destroyed 
	by the time out.
	Added an event ClientSpwanBarrierDestroction to spawn BP_RockBarrierDM, which is a multicast RPC.

- BP_3d_HealthBar:

	Added the no Qi sound and animate the scale when player don't have engouht Qi.

- MPMotionControllerPawn:

	Added the new 3d health and Qi bar on the MP.
	Removed the 2d widget for health and Qi.

- BP_MPMotionController:

	Connected the element feedback to BP_3d_HealthBar.

- BP_MotionControllerPawnTutorial:

	Fixed inssue with the hand instructions on advanced attack.

- BP_AIEnemy:

	Added a new difuclt level for AI called TutorialFirstFight.

- BP_BasicAttack:

	When it destroy barriers the velocity now is kept the same. 

- BP_AdvancedAttack:

	When it destroy barriers the velocity now is kept the same.
===========================================================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/10/19:

- General: 

	Added a new map for traning.
	Added a new BP called BP_PlayerBody. This now host the logic for following the player HMD.

- WBP_MenuRoom:

	Added a new button to go to Traning map.

- MotionControllerPawn:

	Remove the Torso SM from here. Adding to much SM on the player can cost data to replicate in MP. So, I already put in a more MP friendly way.
	Added an event to Spwan the BP_PlayerBody. For MP this will be a multicast rpc.

===========================================================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/10/18:


- MPMotionControllerPawn:

	Fixed CustomMenu for Oculus.

- MotionControllerPawn:

	Fixed CustomMenu for Oculus.
	Removed change of elements that Ian implelemnted from the pawn. Now this is done at the function SetElement at BP_MotionController. Avoid futher bugs, 
	manly on tutorial.
	I desconected the node where Ian roted the hand for Vive. This rotation interfired with the way the basic attack is released. We need to check a 
	better way of doing it. For now don't mess with it. 
	Desconected the SetLocationAndRotation from thick event. Here is not good for performance and there are error being printed related to SM_PlayerTorso. 
	Made the Child actor component attach to DefaultSceneRoot instead of VROrigin. Try to avoid possible diference beteween Vive and Rift, since 
	VROrigin rotates 180d for Vive and not for Rift.
	Added a call to PlayNotEnoughtQiAnim to the new 3D Health bar that Ian created.  

- BP_MotionController:

	Added a parameter HealthQi3DBar. This is set at BeginPlay.
	Added some new logic at the function SetElement. Sets the element feedback to the HealthQiBar.

- FightArena Level BP:

	Added a delay to open the gate to destroy the AI.

- BP_3D_HealthBar:

	Many events here are obsolet now. See the blueprint.
	Added a new event call SetFeedBackColor. This event now deals with what color to set in each sphere.
	At ConstructScript I create two material instances from M_HealtBar to set the elements in each sphere. Ps: the other material 
	instances are now obsolet (Not in use).
	At ConstructScript set ManaInstances and QiBars. Useful for easy manipulation.
	Added a scene componet to hold the Qi Bars. This will be useful to play an animation when Qi is not enought. Then we can just change the 
	scale of the holder instead of one by one. 
	Added a comment node for Ian at SetQiPercent
	Added a new event called PlayNotEnoughtQiAnim. This is called by the Pawn when the Qi is not enoght to perform some action.

- BP_WindShield:

	Center the particle system with the SM.

- BP_FireShield:

	Turn off colision at the SM root. Using only on the SM that Ian added.
	RotationOffSetForLeftHand is 180 at y-axis now. Fix problem on left hand not being show right.  

===========================================================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/10/16:

- General:

	Trying to fix problems on AI not showing up sometimes. After changes couldn't see AI dissapering anymore.
	Remodulate some voices sound.
	Added our AppID to DefaultEngine.ini to 672790.
	We removed buda from MenuLevel. Best to avoid religius simbols. ;)

- BP_Rising_Ground:

	Turn off colison on the SM. Only overlaps now. Fix insues when it was coliding with AI.

===========================================================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/10/10:

- General:

	Reverse Advanced Attacks to work with Face1 buttons. Avoid problems with superposition of events. Need a more carefull implementation here.

- BP_AIHand:

	Added interface BPI_TakeDamage. Fix proplem that AI was not taking damage from shield. 
	Removed logic at ActivateBasicAttack to change water opacity. Moved to BP_WaterBall.

- BP_AirAttackTailProjectile:

	Set DetectionSphere radius to 1 and to no collision. To avoid this detection to happens.

- BP_AIEnemey_Update:

	Added a quick fix for AI to defend advanced air attack. Not sure yet why from sweep returns false only to air.  

- BP_Gwater01:

	Cast tornado before the BeginPlay of Parent. This is necessary to check QI first.
	On event Destroyed it destroy the tornado. 

- BP_WaterShield.

	Increased the size of the collisions physics assets at Water_Shield_1_PhysicsAsset. 

- BP_WaterProjectile:

	Set a life time for projectiles.
	If target is not found destroy projectile.

- BP_WaterBall:

	Override the AI Cast node for change water opacity.
	
===========================================================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/10/09:


- Note: 

	Added new Branch called Alpha-Release.
	Made some fixed or changes that was sent on whatapp. 
	Advanced Attacks now uses the trigger button to be cast as well.
	
- General:

	Inclued a new level for introduction.
	Change the DefaultEngine.ini file, added some networked configuration.

- WBP_MenuRoom:

	Multiplayer button was disable and is not bind to EnableButtons anymore. For aplha-release.

- MotionControllerPawn:

	Disconencted nodes used with mouse.
	Removed some prints.
	SpeedyFactor changed from 0.01 to 0.05

- MPMotionControllerPawn:

	SpeedyFactor changed from 0.01 to 0.05

- BP_HandAI:

	On ActivateAttack if the attack is earth increase the pawn scale to 2.2. This fixes the inssue of earth ball being small at AI. I need to check 
	why this was happening. 
===========================================================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/10/05:

- Notes: 

	Projectiles now can pass throught barriers when they are destroyed.

- Fixes:

	Fix a small bug on the custom menu. Now when you press resume button it turn off the hand interaction properly. 

- MPMotionControllerPawn:

	On macro CastGWater01 now I get the arrow forwardVector instead of the Camera forwardVector. This avoid to get wrong direction. 

- BP_Barrier:

	OnDamage call a function ReduceDamageFromLife that subtract damage from attacks based on barrier's remaning life.

- BP_BasicAttack:

	OnHitComponent event it checks if the hit was at the barrier, if yes, then checks if there are any damage left before destroy the attack. If there are 
	still damage then it reset the projectile moviment after barrier is destroyed. This makes the projectile to go throught.

BP_AdvancedAttack:

	Same as basic attacks.


================================================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/10/04:

 - Important: 

	The BP_Rising_Ground_Earth is now call BP_Rising_Ground. This BP deals now with any element you want to rise. BP_Rising_Ground_Water 
	now is not being used, it become redundant.

- BP_Rising_Ground:

	This class now makes the set up for the element you want to rise from the ground. The set up is made on the constructor script.
	This class has two parameters that must be set on spawn; target to follow and element, in order to work fine. This centralize 
	everything here, end we don't need to repeat code and create more actors.  

- BP_GEarth01:

	Removed the SM added by Ian. Now everything works with the root SM. 
	Add a simples sphere collision on the SM_EarthBall.
	The rotation now only starts after the SpawnEarth timeline is fineshed. Avoid two timelines to run at the same time. (Ps: The Then node do not wait the timeline to 		finish).

- BP_AirAttackTail:

	This actor is now being replicated.
	Added a swicthHasAutority before shoot the projectiles.

- BP_GWater01:

	Set invisible all the components that are no inherited from GWater01. All this compenents must be removed from this actor.
	Created another actor call BP_WaterTornado to do the same thing. This way this actor can be spawn at client 
	and server without replication.

BP_WaterTornado:

	Started the same logic here that Ian did inside the GWater01. Didn't add the particle system yet.

MPMotionControllerPawn: 

	Integrate a custom menu to the mutiplayer pawn. 


- BP_MPMotionController:

	The function Activate Interaction now gets a bool call deactivate and hide the ray cast after. 

================================================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/10/03:

- General:

	Improving performance on multiplayer. 
	All replicated actor have netupdatefrequency from 90 to 100.
	In this version the multiplayer was tested in lan and the lag deacrease A LOT (almost no lag), after the changes made and described below. 
	Improvments in Advanced attacks are still necessary. 

- BP_EarthBall:

	Removed the SM used by Ian, using the same logic with the VisualMesh that was there. Having more SM is probably have for repliaction.
	Now SpawnEarthFromGround is a ClientSpawnEarthFromGround multicast rpc. This way the actor BP_RisingGround_Earth don't need to be replicate.
	ClientSetSacel is now overrinding the parent to set the scale relative. This fixes size problem on Earth using the VisualMesh.

- BP_Rising_Ground_Earth:

	This actor is now replicate anymore.
	SetLifeSpawn is set to 1 sec now. Looks better when it merger with the main actor.

- BP_BasicAttacks:

	Added and event ClientStartChangeAcceleration multicast rpc. This now applies velocity and acceleration. 
	The parameter ProjectileTarget is now replicated.

- BP_EarthBarrier:

	StartZlocation is now -800. This makes the barrier start even more under the ground.

- MPMotionControllerPawn:

	SpeedFactor deacrese from 0.1 to 0.01. It makes barrier start grows very slow. PS: In the future this parameter should belong to the BP_Barrier.

- MotionControllerPawn:

	SpeedFactor deacrese from 0.1 to 0.01. It makes barrier start grows very slow. PS: In the future this parameter should belong to the BP_Barrier.

	

================================================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/10/02:


- General:

	Started to implement all Ian's change to multiplayer as well.

- MotionControllerPawn:

	Added a macro ActivateBeams. This macro has the logic made by Ian to activate the particles for the beam.
	Organized the node for charge aura.
	Removed decay from components and added plane SM (AuraSymbol) to host the material for the symbol at the ground. This makes easier to rescale 
	the image.
	Rescale PlayerAura SM to 3,3,4

- MPMotionControllerPawn:

	Added the logic for charging aura on MP as well.

- BP_MPMotionController:

	Set Only relevant to owner as false. If this is true a lot pro replications erros happen. 
	Added a bool parameter CanAuraCharge, which is set as replicate.

- BP_GAir01:

	Start to implement the Advanced air attack to work in mp. 
	Made some modifications on the spwan AirAttackTrail to attack it regardless hand rotation.


================================================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/09/29:

- General:

	Changed replications setup for the actors: BP_BasicAttack, BP_AdvancedAttacks, BP_Barrier, BP_MPMotionControler, and MPMotionControllerPawn.
	Details and new values were saved in a pdf file and shared with Carlos. Trying to solve problems of lag at the Client.

	Loop for a single player fight done. Now only some parameters ajusting at AI may be required, and later a UI interaction rather than 
	fight again automaticly. Ps: Player can quite the fight at any time using the custom menu.

- FightArena:

	Now you can try to defeat 12 AI levels. I chalange who can...hehe.


================================================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/09/28:

- General:

	Finished first stage AI improviments. AI now cast basic attacks and shield with both hands. Barrier grows only based on the 
	element set on the left hand. It also defends advanced attacks but still don't use it for attack.
	AI now, can be built in diffrent levels and flovors (Elements tha it can manipulate.). 
	To chose a certain AI, select the AI in the level and set the AILevel parameter to one of the options.

	Added a widget call WBP_CustomMenu. The player can pop up this menu pressing the menu button (MC = Shouder, or M on KeyBorad).
	Added a BP_CustomMenu to hold the WBP_CustomMenu.  

- MotionControllerPawn:

	Added an action input called ShowCustomMenu that is triggered when the player press the menu button (MC = Shouder, or M on KeyBorad).
	Added a logic to it for turn on and off the custum menu. (Still some details to fix.)

================================================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/09/27:

- General:

	AI improvments almost done.
	Create 10 different levels of AI. 
	In this version barriers are still off, and the AI defends only with one hand.

================================================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/09/26:

- General:

	Fixed some insues with vibration on hit hands or shield. Before, when shield or hand was hit the player was vibration both controlers. 
	Still working on AI. In this version AI manu not be fully functional. 

- MPMotionControllerPawn:

	Just after the event OnDamage, it checks if damage is bigger than zero, if so, continue otherwise do nothing. This way avoid to shake hands when player is hit
	with no damage.
	Before shake both hands, now it checks if instigator is shield or not. Only rumble both hands if player recived a direct damage.
	The event ClientVibrateCamareAndControllers runs on ownig client only, instead of being a multicast.

- MotionControllerPawn:

	Just after the event OnDamage, it checks if damage is bigger than zero, if so, continue otherwise do nothing. This way avoid to shake hands when player is hit
	with no damage.
	Before shake both hands, now it checks if instigator is shield or not. Only rumble both hands if player recived a direct damage.

- BP_MotionController:

	The event RumbleController added a vibration for rift.
	After the event OnDamage, it calls the RumbleController. This vibrates only the hand that was hit and it plays over shake hands in case this is activate.

- BP_MPMotionController:

	The event RumbleController added a vibration for rift.
	After the event OnDamage, it calls the RumbleController. This vibrates only the hand that was hit and it plays over shake hands in case this is activate.

================================================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/09/25:

- General:

	Name of AI bp changed from AIEnemy_BP to BP_AIEnemy_Update (Temporary).

- BP_AIEnemy_Update:

	BasicAttack update to work similar to the new way of casting.
	Mostly of the basick attack and shield logic are being passed to BP_AIhand. This way the logic for both hands attack and defense will be easier to implement.

-  BP_AIhand:

	Basic attack casting system implemented.
	Started the shield implementation.


================================================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/09/22:

- BP_AdvancedAttacks:

	Added an ServerCheckForQi server RPC. Runs only on the server to check and consume qi.

- MPMotionControllerPawn:

	At the function CastBarrier, now gets the server hand velocity instead of GetHandVelociity only. This should fix problems for the client to cast the barrier.

- MotionControllerPawnTutorial:

	Fixed minor bugs.
================================================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/09/16:

- General: Added some comments node at BP_WaterShield, BP_RisingGround_Water to Ian.

- Note: BP_RisingGround_Water and BP_RisingGround_Earth are basicly the same object. We could make one Actor, and change the FXs only.

- BP_RisingGround_Water:

	Added a new parameter TargetToFollow. This is an actor type and can be used for both, WaterShield and WaterBall.

- BP_RisingGround_Earth:

	Actor now is tick as replicate, and replicate movements.
	Comment boxes fix, replace water for earth. 

- AIEnemy_BP:

	Improving Tutorial.

================================================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/09/11:

	Important note: In this version the way of charging basic attacks was modified. Basicly, was introduced a new layer for trigger the attacks.
	This will control the passe of the game and give a feeling of being more powerfull. :)..hopefully. 

- General: 

	Added a new channel for collision callled Detector. It is used to charge the advanced attacs now.
	Added a macro on the library, IsTimeHandlerActive, to check if a given TimerHandler is active or not.  

- BP_WaterBall:

	Added some comments in the nodes.
	Removed the TimeLine event. This should be deal by the Parent.
	Changed the curve data for scale (WaterScale) in order to make the grow works on the parent.
	The event SpawnWaterFromGround is now an Server RPC and the name was changed to ServerSpawnWaterFromGround to keep the structure of names.
	The TimeToChargeAttack (at BasicSpellData) was modife from 0.5s to 2s, for testing reasons. This is controllled by the balancing in the final game.

- BP_RisingGround_Water:

	Actor now is replicate. 
	At event BeginPlay I removed the set timer by event and added a SetLifeSpan. Only for cosmetics and is gets more clear.
	The parameter WaterballBP is now setted at Spawn. This way, it guarantee that this parameter will be passed to the actor at BeginPlay.

- BP_MotionController:

	New events added. They are all within the comment boxe "Check if hand is point to detectors for start attacks". This basicly now, controls 
	when to start or stop to charge the attacks.

- MotionControllerPawn:

	The inputAction events, AttackRight and AttackLeft, now calls the events StartTraceLine and StopTraceLine at press and release respectively.
	Added two new StaticMeshComponent, PlayerAura for give player feedback about status on element, qi and maybe life. Attach to it a Detector,
	This is used to detect if the hands are point down to start charge the basic attacks.

- BP_MPMotionController:

	New events added. They are all within the comment boxe "Check if hand is point to detectors for start attacks". This basicly now, controls 
	when to start or stop to charge the attacks.

- MPMotionControllerPawn:

	The inputAction events, AttackRight and AttackLeft, now calls the events StartTraceLine and StopTraceLine at press and release respectively.
	Added two new StaticMeshComponent, PlayerAura for give player feedback about status on element, qi and maybe life. Attach to it a Detector,
	This is used to detect if the hands are point down to start charge the basic attacks.

================================================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/09/05:

 - General:

	Many changes on balancing and UX.
	Positions and sizes of some widgets were modifed. 

================================================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/08/31:


- General:
	
	Added a data structure that is feed by external files. The main elementes of the game use those data to set its 
	inicial parameters that are related to balancing. Right now there are three tables in use: InitialPlayerData conected to the 
	MotionControlPawn, MPMotionControlPawn and child. AdvancedAttackData conected with BP_AdvancedAttacks and child and by the last 
	BasicSpellsData conected to BP_BasicAttack, BP_Shield, BP_Barrier and child.

-Important note:

	The parameters connect to the tables cited above can't be change anymore on the editor, once there will be no effect. If, you want to 
	change a given value, i.e BaseLife, you need to change it in the table for the respective object you want to do so.

- MPMotionControllerPawn:

================================================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/08/18:

Note: In this version all the basic attacks will play a fire sound. This is not a bug. David is building the Cue sounds 
for the other elements. 


- General:

	Create a new attenuation file for the sounds called GeneralAttenuation. This is used by some Cue sounds. 

- BP_BasicAttacks:

	Client events for cast explositon and fail were substitute for a single multicast event ClientPlayEmitterAndSound. This event takes as 
input a particle system and a sound reference. This is more generic.
	Added a new event ClientPlayAudio. This is a multicast RPC to play an audio. It takes an audio component as input.
	Added a new event ClientPlayAudioWithTransition. This is a multicast RPC to play a new audio and fade out another one. It takes two audio component as input, the fade out audio and the new audio, and the time to fade out the audio.
	At the event FireBasicAttack there is a ClientPlayAudio if player don't fail to cast it. This play a punch audio.

	CastGFire01, now after spawn and attack to hand it calls the event StartReleasingAA.

- MPMotionControllerPawn:  

	Now, advanced attacks are not trigger if player is in silence mode.

- BP_MotionController:

	Added an new event called StartReleasingAA. This event checks for hand velocity and shoots the attack when the critereas are 
complet.

- BP_GFire:

	On Destroy event it checks if the spell is still a parent from hand, if true it stops the timer on the StartReleasingAA.

- BP_AdvancedAttacks:

	The event CastAdvancedAttack was syncronized with the event FireBasicAttack. It gives better performance on acelleration 
of the projectile.

	

================================================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/08/16:

- General:

	New sounds effects added on the project.
	Some minor balance with barrier life and timelife.

- MyGameInstance:

	At ShowLoadingScreen, now if IsVrNoActive is false it tries to get BP_MenuNetworking to set the loading screen for vr. This 
was done to call the loading screen when the player try to join a section. (Need to test.) 

- HostMenuVR:

	On this widget at OnClicked AcceptButton the node that calls the loading screen for vr was removed, sine it now is done by 
the game instance. (Need to test.)
	
- BP_Barrier:

	Added an Event ClientPlayExplosion. This is call when barrier has life lower than 0. 

- BP_MotionController:

	At InitiateAttack when cast status is Attack do nothing. Avoid restart attack when triger is pressed.

- BP_MPMotionController:

	At ClientInitiateAttack when cast status is Attack do nothing. Avoid restart attack when triger is pressed.

- BP_GEarth01:

	OnComponentHit, now it uses the hand velocity to shoot the rock instead of normal impulse. So far it shows 
better performance on multiplayer.

================================================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/08/15:

- General:

	New sounds effects added on the project.

- Multiplayer tested:
 
	Restart match now works and the new mechanic for casting the attacks work fine as well.
	Inssues - Vibration still need to be fixed and the attack GEarth01 sometimes get stuck when hit by hand, even 
on the new way of releasing it. Possible problem is related with the hit normal impulse component. 


- MPMotionControllerPawn:

	On Macro GFire01 the Location was changed from (0,5,0) to (0,-12,0). This take into acount the change of AttackSpawnPoint.
	Removed the events ServerIniciateAttack, ServerCastAttack and ServerCastShield. They are now on BP_MPMotionController.

- BP_MotionController:

	Envent Hit was deactivate. This is now deal at BP_GEarth01.
	Changed HandMesh scale from (1,1,1) to (0.8,0.9,0.9).
	Changed HandMesh material from master_hand_004 to M_skyxmat (universe hand).

- BP_MPMotionController:

	Envent Hit was deactivate. This is now deal at BP_GEarth01.
	Changed HandMesh scale from (1,1,1) to (0.8,0.9,0.9).
	Changed HandMesh material from master_hand_004 to M_skyxmat (universe hand).
	Added the events ServerIniciateAttack, ServerCastAttack and ServerCastShield which came from MPMotionControllerPaw.
	At the end of ServerIniciateAttack a timer is triger to keep checking hand velocity and direction to cast the attacks.See node for more detail.
	Now the functions DeactivateSpell and DeacticvateAndDestroySpell check if CastStatus is equal to silence mode 
before set CastStatus to none. This fix for once the problem of activate attack when in silence mode and reduce the number of 
calls needed to check if player is in silence mode considerly.
	DeacticvateAndDestroySpell now also cleans the timer handler call ActivateAttackTimeHandler. This function now is 
responsable to stop the timer handler that trigger the event ReleaseOnPunch.  

- BP_GEarth01:

	Envent OnHitComponent now deals with shooting earth when hitted by hand. 


===================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/08/14:

- General:

	Update the materias for the Barrier and the landscape. This fix the insue with the floor seems bumped.
	Minor changes on the light at the Maps FightArena and MultiplayeArena.
	Changed the landscape z location from 100 to 110, on both FightArena and MultiplayeArena. This compensate the 
material change and bring the floor to the right level. Correction on barrier vizual effects were made to addapt 
to it as well.

- BP_MotionController:

	DeactivateAndDeastroySpell now deactivate the rumble on the controllers before the cast nodes. Fix insue when the ActiveSpell 
was not valid the vibration wans't being turned off.

	Override the Event Destroyed. If BP_MotionController or BP_MPMotionController are attached parents when it's destroyed 
it deactivate the attack on the hand.

===================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/08/10:

- BP_Barrier:

	Added a new event StartDestroying. This event runs a TimeLine to brings the barrier down and destroy it. Before the barrier was 
destroy after x secs. Now this will animate the barrier down before destroy it. The implementation is still in progress. 

- BP_MotionController:

	Added new event CastShield. This event is similar of of we have on MPMotionControllerPawn, althought now it was moved to the hand (BP_MotionController).
	CastShield has one modification. Now, if CastStatus is on Attack it destroy and deactivate the attack and cast shield. Before it wouldn't do anything at attack mode. This fits better to the new mechanics of the attacks. 

- MotionControllerPawn:

	Now in the function CastBarrier the nodes Switch onCastStatus, the attack destroy and deactivate the attack and cast barrier. Before it wouldn't do anything at attack mode. This fits better to the new mechanics of the attacks.   

- BP_BasicAttacks:

	Event CastBaseAttack don't recive velocity input anymore. It's now how it was before.
	The function GetVelocityDirectionAndFactorfromPlayer returns one more float parameter, speed. Thi is for debuging use.
	Within the function GetVelocityDirectionAndFactorfromPlayer the conversition between player speed and factor was changed 
to another function. It nows interpolate between 3 values rather than use a logarithimic function to do it. This can simplifiy the process to balance the convertion between player speed and spell speed.


===================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/08/09:

	Note: Structural changes made on the node to cast basic attacks. Read carefully below.

- BP_MotionController:

	Added the events IniciateAttack and CastAttack which came from the MotionControllerPaw.
	At the end of IniciateAttack a timer is triger to keep checking hand velocity and direction to cast the attacks. 
See node for more detail.
	Now the functions DeactivateSpell and DeacticvateAndDestroySpell check if CastStatus is equal to silence mode 
before set CastStatus to none. This fix for once the problem of activate attack when in silence mode and reduce the number of 
calls needed to check if player is in silence mode considerly.
	DeacticvateAndDestroySpell now also cleans the timer handler call ActivateAttackTimeHandler. This function now is 
responsable to stop the timer handler that trigger the event ReleaseOnPunch.  
	

===================================================================================================================

- MotionControllerPawn:
	
	On Macro GFire01 the Location was changed from (0,5,0) to (0,-12,0). This take into acount the change of AttackSpawnPoint.
	Added two new events, IniciateAttack and Cast Attack. This events hold the start and end for casting the basic attacks and work in the same way as in the MPMotionControllerPawn.
	Added two new events that are bind by a SettimerByEvent. ReleaseLeftPunch and ReleaseRightPunch. This events check if you are punch to release the basic attacks. Basic Attacks are no longer released by releasing the trigger button.
	Two new int var created, AttacksReleaseRight and AttacksReleaseLeft. This integers count how many times the player release attack, if it execides a given value the player cannot shot anymore and He/She must release the trigger button to start over.
	

BP_BasicAttacks:

	Event CastBaseAttack nows recive a vector parameter call velocity. Now the player pawn pass this information to the basic attack. This fixe inssues with velocity on the new way basicattacks are casted.
