Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/08/31:


- General:
	
	Added a data structure that is feed by external files. The main elementes of the game use those data to set its 
	inicial parameters that are related to balancing. Right now there are three tables in use: InitialPlayerData conected to the 
	MotionControlPawn, MPMotionControlPawn and child. AdvancedAttackData conected with BP_AdvancedAttacks and child and by the last 
	BasicSpellsData conected to BP_BasicAttack, BP_Shield, BP_Barrier and child.

-Important note:

	The parameters connect to the tables cited above can't be change anymore on the editor, once there will be no effect. If, you want to 
	change a given value, i.e BaseLife, you need to change it in the table for the respective object you want to do so.

- MPMotionControllerPawn:

	QiRegeneration don't start on beging play anymore. An event ServerStartQiRegeneration was created and it's call at ClientStatMatch. This 
	solve the problem of the player start Qi regeneration before the other player enter at the arena.

Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/08/18:

Note: In this version all the basic attacks will play a fire sound. This is not a bug. David is building the Cue sounds 
for the other elements. 


- General:

	Create a new attenuation file for the sounds called GeneralAttenuation. This is used by some Cue sounds. 

- BP_BasicAttacks:

	Client events for cast explositon and fail were substitute for a single multicast event ClientPlayEmitterAndSound. This event takes as 
input a particle system and a sound reference. This is more generic.
	Added a new event ClientPlayAudio. This is a multicast RPC to play an audio. It takes an audio component as input.
	Added a new event ClientPlayAudioWithTransition. This is a multicast RPC to play a new audio and fade out another one. It takes two audio component as input, the fade out audio and the new audio, and the time to fade out the audio.
	At the event FireBasicAttack there is a ClientPlayAudio if player don't fail to cast it. This play a punch audio.
	Added new audio components.

- All Child from BP_BasicAttacks:

	Now, advanced attacks are not trigger if player is in silence mode.
	TryToReleaseAdvanceAttack has no function anymore. Now this is done by the hand as the basicAttacks.
	CastGFire01, now after spawn and attack to hand it calls the event StartReleasingAA.

- MPMotionControllerPawn:  

	Now, advanced attacks are not trigger if player is in silence mode.

- BP_MotionController:

	Added an new event called StartReleasingAA. This event checks for hand velocity and shoots the attack when the critereas are 
complet.

- BP_GFire:

	On Destroy event it checks if the spell is still a parent from hand, if true it stops the timer on the StartReleasingAA.

- BP_AdvancedAttacks:

	The event CastAdvancedAttack was syncronized with the event FireBasicAttack. It gives better performance on acelleration 
of the projectile.

	

================================================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/08/16:

- General:

	New sounds effects added on the project.
	Some minor balance with barrier life and timelife.

- MyGameInstance:

	At ShowLoadingScreen, now if IsVrNoActive is false it tries to get BP_MenuNetworking to set the loading screen for vr. This 
was done to call the loading screen when the player try to join a section. (Need to test.) 

- HostMenuVR:

	On this widget at OnClicked AcceptButton the node that calls the loading screen for vr was removed, sine it now is done by 
the game instance. (Need to test.)
	
- BP_Barrier:

	Added an Event ClientPlayExplosion. This is call when barrier has life lower than 0. 

- BP_MotionController:

	At InitiateAttack when cast status is Attack do nothing. Avoid restart attack when triger is pressed.

- BP_MPMotionController:

	At ClientInitiateAttack when cast status is Attack do nothing. Avoid restart attack when triger is pressed.

- BP_GEarth01:

	OnComponentHit, now it uses the hand velocity to shoot the rock instead of normal impulse. So far it shows 
better performance on multiplayer.

================================================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/08/15:

- General:

	New sounds effects added on the project.

- Multiplayer tested:
 
	Restart match now works and the new mechanic for casting the attacks work fine as well.
	Inssues - Vibration still need to be fixed and the attack GEarth01 sometimes get stuck when hit by hand, even 
on the new way of releasing it. Possible problem is related with the hit normal impulse component. 


- MPMotionControllerPawn:

	On Macro GFire01 the Location was changed from (0,5,0) to (0,-12,0). This take into acount the change of AttackSpawnPoint.
	Removed the events ServerIniciateAttack, ServerCastAttack and ServerCastShield. They are now on BP_MPMotionController.

- BP_MotionController:

	Envent Hit was deactivate. This is now deal at BP_GEarth01.
	Changed HandMesh scale from (1,1,1) to (0.8,0.9,0.9).
	Changed HandMesh material from master_hand_004 to M_skyxmat (universe hand).

- BP_MPMotionController:

	Envent Hit was deactivate. This is now deal at BP_GEarth01.
	Changed HandMesh scale from (1,1,1) to (0.8,0.9,0.9).
	Changed HandMesh material from master_hand_004 to M_skyxmat (universe hand).
	Added the events ServerIniciateAttack, ServerCastAttack and ServerCastShield which came from MPMotionControllerPaw.
	At the end of ServerIniciateAttack a timer is triger to keep checking hand velocity and direction to cast the attacks.See node for more detail.
	Now the functions DeactivateSpell and DeacticvateAndDestroySpell check if CastStatus is equal to silence mode 
before set CastStatus to none. This fix for once the problem of activate attack when in silence mode and reduce the number of 
calls needed to check if player is in silence mode considerly.
	DeacticvateAndDestroySpell now also cleans the timer handler call ActivateAttackTimeHandler. This function now is 
responsable to stop the timer handler that trigger the event ReleaseOnPunch.  

- BP_GEarth01:

	Envent OnHitComponent now deals with shooting earth when hitted by hand. 


===================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/08/14:

- General:

	Update the materias for the Barrier and the landscape. This fix the insue with the floor seems bumped.
	Minor changes on the light at the Maps FightArena and MultiplayeArena.
	Changed the landscape z location from 100 to 110, on both FightArena and MultiplayeArena. This compensate the 
material change and bring the floor to the right level. Correction on barrier vizual effects were made to addapt 
to it as well.

- BP_MotionController:

	DeactivateAndDeastroySpell now deactivate the rumble on the controllers before the cast nodes. Fix insue when the ActiveSpell 
was not valid the vibration wans't being turned off.

	Override the Event Destroyed. If BP_MotionController or BP_MPMotionController are attached parents when it's destroyed 
it deactivate the attack on the hand.

===================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/08/10:

- BP_Barrier:

	Added a new event StartDestroying. This event runs a TimeLine to brings the barrier down and destroy it. Before the barrier was 
destroy after x secs. Now this will animate the barrier down before destroy it. The implementation is still in progress. 

- BP_MotionController:

	Added new event CastShield. This event is similar of of we have on MPMotionControllerPawn, althought now it was moved to the hand (BP_MotionController).
	CastShield has one modification. Now, if CastStatus is on Attack it destroy and deactivate the attack and cast shield. Before it wouldn't do anything at attack mode. This fits better to the new mechanics of the attacks. 

- MotionControllerPawn:

	Now in the function CastBarrier the nodes Switch onCastStatus, the attack destroy and deactivate the attack and cast barrier. Before it wouldn't do anything at attack mode. This fits better to the new mechanics of the attacks.   

- BP_BasicAttacks:

	Event CastBaseAttack don't recive velocity input anymore. It's now how it was before.
	The function GetVelocityDirectionAndFactorfromPlayer returns one more float parameter, speed. Thi is for debuging use.
	Within the function GetVelocityDirectionAndFactorfromPlayer the conversition between player speed and factor was changed 
to another function. It nows interpolate between 3 values rather than use a logarithimic function to do it. This can simplifiy the process to balance the convertion between player speed and spell speed.


===================================================================================================================
Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/08/09:

	Note: Structural changes made on the node to cast basic attacks. Read carefully below.

- BP_MotionController:

	Added the events IniciateAttack and CastAttack which came from the MotionControllerPaw.
	At the end of IniciateAttack a timer is triger to keep checking hand velocity and direction to cast the attacks. 
See node for more detail.
	Now the functions DeactivateSpell and DeacticvateAndDestroySpell check if CastStatus is equal to silence mode 
before set CastStatus to none. This fix for once the problem of activate attack when in silence mode and reduce the number of 
calls needed to check if player is in silence mode considerly.
	DeacticvateAndDestroySpell now also cleans the timer handler call ActivateAttackTimeHandler. This function now is 
responsable to stop the timer handler that trigger the event ReleaseOnPunch.  
	

===================================================================================================================

- MotionControllerPawn:
	
	On Macro GFire01 the Location was changed from (0,5,0) to (0,-12,0). This take into acount the change of AttackSpawnPoint.
	Added two new events, IniciateAttack and Cast Attack. This events hold the start and end for casting the basic attacks and work in the same way as in the MPMotionControllerPawn.
	Added two new events that are bind by a SettimerByEvent. ReleaseLeftPunch and ReleaseRightPunch. This events check if you are punch to release the basic attacks. Basic Attacks are no longer released by releasing the trigger button.
	Two new int var created, AttacksReleaseRight and AttacksReleaseLeft. This integers count how many times the player release attack, if it execides a given value the player cannot shot anymore and He/She must release the trigger button to start over.
	

BP_BasicAttacks:

	Event CastBaseAttack nows recive a vector parameter call velocity. Now the player pawn pass this information to the basic attack. This fixe inssues with velocity on the new way basicattacks are casted.
