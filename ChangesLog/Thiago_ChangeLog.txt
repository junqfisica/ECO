Changes made to branch 4.16 on 2017/07/06:


IMPORTANT NOTE: The Local test in VR using only one HMD works very well. The HMD only sees the server camera. 

Note: On single HMD test Server-Client move each other hands and head. However, it's all fine with two HMDs.

General:

	- Added the Command Line "Stereo On" at the multiplayer Map.

Blueprint classes:

- MPMotionControllerPawn:

	Fixed bug on MotionControllerR component: Parameter Hand set as Right (instead of Left).
	Spawn Hands now use SwitchHasAuthority, instead of IsLocallyControlled. 
	Small delay (1sec) added before call SetInitialConditions. This fix the references on the Left Controller and Right Controller parameter. Before this references were none for the player2.  
	PlayerBody was Toggle true on Rendering Owner No See.
	A meshe call Mask was add as a child of PlayerBody. This mashe holds the mask.
	Cleaned the thick event.
	Changed function SetInitialConditions; initial elements are set in the function. This now works because hands are spawn with SwitchHasAuthority and a small delay was added to wait BP_MPMotionController to make its setup. 
	New Macro IsInSilenceMode add. Unfinish on MotionControllerPawn

- BP_MPMotionController: 

	Enum parameter Hand is now replicated. This makes the hand mesh invert correclty and both hand meshes
are correct in the client now.
